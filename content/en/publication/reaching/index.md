In order to reach our arm to a given target, there are infinite number of choices in the selection of arm joint trajectory.
Many theoretical studies proposed criterion that explain the characteristics of the arm reaching trajectory, e.g., minimum jerk model, minimum torque change model, and minimum endpoint variance model.

We have shown that many characteristics of the arm reaching trajectory can also be explained by the minimum energetic cost model, the same criterion that explains the characteristics of locomotor patterns.
