Multi-legged animals, such as insects and quadrupeds show stable locomotor patterns on various road surfaces and against disturbances with changing many locomotion parameters such as the stride period, duty ratio, and gait pattern according to the movement speed. 

We are building mathematical models using robotics method and machine learning techniques how the nervous system achieves the learning control to realize such locomotor patterns and other various kinds of movements.
